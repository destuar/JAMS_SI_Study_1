They shooed us away to go pick up a desk phone to “get someone else to help” because there was nothing onsite Delta agents could do. We LITERALLY had to sit in the cold, depressing customer service lounge on the phone for four hours to find an option. The BEST option we were given was to take 5 flights to eventually reach our destination. I’m optimistic so I agreed. After two days of travel we arrived despite being humiliated that our connecting flights sky club lounge doesn’t accept stamped boarding passes any longer to honor 24 hour access.
