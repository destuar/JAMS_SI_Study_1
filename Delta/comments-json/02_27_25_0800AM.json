I contacted customer service and was on the call for almost 4 hours. Then the agent was gone and I wasn’t sure if I was booked or not. So I checked the app and I have a new booking with a 7 hour layover in Seattle (thanks for that) and have been downgraded from premium to the back of the planes. I fly Delta Air Lines internationally twice a year, and they either lose my luggage or bump me off flights or leave me stranded in airports for 24 hours because they can’t get connections right. Today was just too much for me. This airline doesn’t care about its passengers, and doesn’t compensate them for the blunders they make or even honor the upgrades they pay for. I’ve been stupid to keep hoping my next experience with them will be a good one and that’s my own fault, but lesson learned this time. What a disappointing airline.",

They shooed us away to go pick up a desk phone to “get someone else to help” because there was nothing onsite Delta agents could do. We LITERALLY had to sit in the cold, depressing customer service lounge on the phone for four hours to find an option. The BEST option we were given was to take 5 flights to eventually reach our destination. I’m optimistic so I agreed. After two days of travel we arrived despite being humiliated that our connecting flights sky club lounge doesn’t accept stamped boarding passes any longer to honor 24 hour access.
