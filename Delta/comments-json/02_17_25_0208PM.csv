Apparently, the First Officer was flying the approach and landing into Toronto. He had about a year with Endeavor. With the weather conditions as they were, should the Captain have made the landing?

Thankfully the flight attendant was well aware of what they were doing, and after the pilot announced a brief delay, two policemen came on the plane and removed them. Hooray!
