The bubbly lass at gate 18 for the ATL-PVD was brilliant! Wish I remembered her name. The crew of both (FULL) flights were professional and handled passengers who didnt know where their seat was, well - time after time. Ed Bastian these folks deserve a RAISE - you should be proud of all of them!!!!! On a down side dont care much for the new airbus planes, cabin noise in places is louder than it should be and the AC control on one plane came away from its housing and could be pushed up. No biggie but detracts from the experience. Do Delta plan on adopting the European standard for cabin baggage? I wish all airlines would reduce the size of allowed cabin baggage.",2025-02-08,initial,12

They shooed us away to go pick up a desk phone to “get someone else to help” because there was nothing onsite Delta agents could do. We LITERALLY had to sit in the cold, depressing customer service lounge on the phone for four hours to find an option. The BEST option we were given was to take 5 flights to eventually reach our destination. I’m optimistic so I agreed.

A day ahead of my three flights to England you said my first flight was delayed by 2 hours. How is it ALREADY delayed? It’s the day before. The delay would make me miss my subsequent flights. I contacted customer service and was on the call for almost 4 hours. Then the agent was gone and I wasn’t sure if I was booked or not. So I checked the app and I have a new booking with a 7 hour layover in Seattle (thanks for that) and have been downgraded from premium to the back of the planes. I fly Delta Air Lines internationally twice a year, and they either lose my luggage or bump me off flights or leave me stranded in airports for 24 hours because they can’t get connections right. Today was just too much for me. This airline doesn’t care about its passengers, and doesn’t compensate them for the blunders they make or even honor the upgrades they pay for.

However, after waiting and going back and forth for about an hour, the service rep across from b19 tried to assist with a room booking, but when we attempted to open the voucher we were given, we discovered it was null and void once we tried to check in and we had to now go back to the service/ ticketing desk in the baggage claim area of the airport this time. The agents there had us wait another hour and a half as they debated about the person in the b concourse, how they were ready to get off, someone having the ability to fix it but not wanting to do so, how the medical emergency wasn’t logged in their system, how they didn’t want to go behind what someone else’s work, whether they could give a paper or digital voucher, if they were going to give us one at all, shift duties, etc. Trying not to show my frustration with their conversation I continued to practice patience as my flight had landed around 840pm and it was close to midnight. A supervisor named Vonda finally cleared the hotel. However, when arriving to the airport in the morning we were still faced with the dilemma of getting our alcohol purchase through TSA, so I called customer service on the way back to the airport and explained, the customer service rep over the phone stated that we should be able to have a “red jacket” or supervisor walk us through TSA, but that was not the case. When we got to the service desk this time we were told we would have to purchase another bag/ luggage to put the alcohol items inside of at 7am…and then check the bag in or have our bags pulled so that we could put our items inside and recheck those bags in all with the possibility of missing another flight. With no time to go purchase luggage we chose the second option sprinting through the airport to get it done. Once we had our bags pulled we had to wait in another line to check them in again which took up a good amount of time, but after a long night and morning we were just happy to be home. However, this of course caused me to miss work and a job interview with little to easement besides it wasn’t Delta Air Lines fault.

Even with the horrible changes to MQDs over MQMs we would still return to premium status with our next flight to NY this new year. Imagine our surprise when we realized that Mr. Bastian had removed the rollover piece of the SkyMiles program as well. Let us ask you, what demonstrates more loyalty than longevity. The fact that we’ve been flying Delta and SkyTeam consistently for more than a decade demonstrates loyalty. Rolling over the MQDs is a way of rewarding continued flying and increasing retention. If you reset status every year without considering what’s been given in the past, it means more ‘What have you done for me lately?’ That’s a question to ask of someone working for you, not someone being loyal to you, someone that you’re working for.
