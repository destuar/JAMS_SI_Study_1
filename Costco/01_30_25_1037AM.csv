When Costco first came to our town, I remember talking to someone who left his job at a similar warehouse store to work at Costco. He reported loving his job saying that Costco treated him with more respect and dignity--and paid better with better benefits. He was more committed to his job and the company because of this. This included him wanting to do the best job that he could do to show appreciation to Costco for how they treated employees. We already liked Costco, but after this, we became much more committed.
