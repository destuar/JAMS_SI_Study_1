As a nonmember, you may still purchase prescriptions from a Costco pharmacy with cash, debit, Costco Shop Cards or a Visa® card.

We take great pride in the quality and savings we offer our members.

Not myself, not the members of whichever political affiliation I agree with the most, not just women. There is this selfish undertone that I should agree with it because I benefit from it. On the contrary, the negativity and senseless hatred I see as a direct result of this defunct policy is the number one reason it won’t work. It was implemented prior to be being scrutinized to ensure it was appropriate, it was blindly accepted as the end to systemic racism while we are all experiencing the worst level of division since the 1960’s, and it places us all in our respective racial and even sexual preference groups. I reject this in favor of what most of us have inherent in us and were taught from an early age: treat all people how you would like to be treated.

I provide the source for global guidelines on this below. Affirmative Action was deemed unconstitutional because it does not align with the liberties afforded to all citizens by our constitution. The premise of equality for all, as we are guaranteed as citizens, cannot properly be afforded without a colorblind society. This does not mean we try to erase history, and it also does not mean we disregard the experiences of those who are considered to have a boost in society by DEI standards. In its most recent form, and more so in mass media, social media, and in some politicians minds, this is affirmative action with a prettier name. DEI was pushed onto corporations large and small, along with schools of higher education, with financial incentives for those who choose to report to an organization that isn’t for *all* human rights. For example, both Harvard and Penn State both required between 300 and 500 points less from those who benefit from DEI. That is not inclusive. But even more important is that it is not understood by a legal standpoint by the news outlets that air or publish DEI-related content, the celebrities our children might look up to, and too many of the politicians tasked with creating or abolishing any given policy. And if you ask 100 people what DEI means, you will get 100 different answers. It is not bipartisan by any means. And its specific goals are not outlined in black and white for the average citizen.
