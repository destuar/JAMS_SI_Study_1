I have the receipt email showing that I purchased it and AT&T says I’ve never purchased. It says they’ll put notes in the file. nobody calls me, and there are no notes, so I ask what happened and they said they could sell me $100 cruise line it didn’t work bottom line is I use the phone three times and a few text it cost me $550 and Costco AT&T want to talk to me about it Costco says they’ll have somebody call me.
