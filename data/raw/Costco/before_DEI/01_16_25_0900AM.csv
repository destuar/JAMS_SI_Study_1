You are saying anyone except white men are only hired because of dei. That isn't true. Many backgrounds and nationalities have been working at Costco way before DEI. DEI isn't just hiring. They also by the products by dei. not necessarily the best prices. DEI doesn't only refer to hiring. They will handle products that may not be the best or best price. One example: I by hydrogen peroxide. At Costco 2 bottles was $2.49. Sam's club $1.97. Gas that same day was cheaper at Sam's Club. Walmart refill hand soap was almost half the price of Costco.
