People are not economic units. There’s no perfect way to evaluate them and there is NEVER a situation where two candidates are completely equal in skill level, education, experience, interview ability, personality, etc. It just doesn’t happen. There may be times when you’ve got two good candidates that might be tough to choose between, but that doesn’t mean you go with the minority. In those cases, HR generally works with the hiring manager to decide which qualifications would be the most important. Maybe for a sales role, you have to great candidates but one is better at phone sales and one seems to be better at door to door sales so you choose based on which is most prevalent in the company.",2025-01-24,reply,3
