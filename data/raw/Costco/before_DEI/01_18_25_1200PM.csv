The immense amount of pollution that's caused is unreal and when the nets fail as they did in the Pacific Northwest we now have a problem with them taking out native salmon species that the orcas need to survive The reason why these orcas babies are dying because they're grossly underweight because the orcas cannot get access to fresh salmon.
