The first rule of communication is that we communicate for the purpose of getting what we want. Communication is about getting something that we want. If you stop and think about it, there is no communication that that doesn't involve trying to get what you want. For example....you see someone walking down the hall with an untied shoelace. At some level, you either don't want the person to trip...and / or...you want to be the one to warn the person about the potential for tripping...so you communicate to them that their shoe is untied. Either way...you wanted something out of the encounter...so you communicated. Simple as that. If you can give me an example of communication that doesn't involve trying to get something you want...I'm all ears! Ha! In my nearly 40 years of developing people, no one has ever been able to give me an example of communication that doesn't involve getting what they want. So your desire to comment for days at a time about this subject involves you getting what you want. Perhaps you are being paid to communicate and defend Costco's DEI practices...and that is your motivation...(Money equals safety and security...the first two goals of all humanity). But even if you are being paid, the zealotry you bring to the comments and your willingness to insult, demean and abuse others shows that your primary communication style is driven by your Parental Ego State. On the other hand...I primarily operate out of an Adult Ego State...and I only choose to use the Parental Ego State when I want to poke fun at an idea, comment or person. You and a few others on this thread use the Parental Ego State...and it's fun to poke the bear! Ha! Ha! Ha! When I comment, my goal is to influence the way people think, and I almost always start out from an adult ego state. But when I run into people who are incapable of active listening...or have a goal other than to express themselves and influence others...I have great fun taking their comments apart...and that sometimes includes using the Parental Ego State. I never use the Child Ego State, where someone is always blaming others for the negative outcomes in their life, but there are plenty of people on this thread using it...as they need to find someone to balme for the negative outcomes in their life. Thus the need to blame ""racism"" for their personal failures. I hope that clears it up for you. Ha! Ha! Ha!",2025-02-01,reply,0

Your comment about pay increases for performance or longevity would be hilarious if they weren't so sad. You refuse to acknowledge that the choices women make impact their ability to make more money. Where are the oil-rig women? Where are the brick-laying women? Where are the high-wire steel-working women?

You have no idea what you are talking about, as your stupid comment about having babies displays. Yes, some people take a couple of weeks out of work to have their baby, and some take months or years out of the workforce to care for their babies. Some women choose to take a decade out of the workforce to establish their familes, then they go back to work.

I was raised by corrupt, racist, drunken parents who were in law enforcement. My Dad was a six-foot-nine, 350 pound racist St. Louis Cop and my Mother was a corrupt Court Clerk who was charged with embezzling $80,000 from the ticket fund to finance her BINGO habit. I and my siblings were beaten, yelled at and humilated in so many ways, it shocked the therapist. I wrote a book about the experience, and am working on having it made into a movie. The Book is called Webster Groves, and is available on Amazon and other book sellers. I was also a Federally Protected Whistle Blower for over 20 years with US DoD, and was abused by them for two decades, until I forced them into retiring me on disability when I began to pass out while teaching large Management Development Classes for DoD... work due to their abuses. The therapist helped me with managing those issues as well. But the best use of therapy was when I was diagnosed as having been epileptic at the age of 49, and told that I had been enduring unobserved seizures throughout my life. I was also diagnosed with a condition called ""Post Seizure Fugue State""... where once I have a seizure I can complete remarkable tasks for about an hour after the seizure, and have no awareness that I am doing anything, nor any memory of having done anything. This conditon manifested itself one day when I had a seizure and unknowingly drove a car. I ended up driving off a 200 foot cliff at 70 mph, with my body being sucked out the back window and getting tossed 200 feet down the cliff. I woke up for a heartbeat as the rescue helicoptor lifted me from the canyon floor. I was hospitalized with my back broken in four spots, my neck broken in 3 places, six broken ribs, a crushed tailbone, a 93 stitch gash across my face....and a 19 staple rip to my brain. My unkown epilepsy delivered several near death experiences...while I was working in war zones and other unique situations. The therapy really helped me to process this lifelong disabilty and it's effect on my life. The therapy helped me to understand that much of my desire to understand how my brain worked, wasn't due to prior trauma, but due to the unknown seizures. I hope that clears up the therapy thing for you, but feel free to make fun of me some more...as I have had a incredible life, and I always appreciate the opportunity to tell my story! Ha! Ha!

But don't blame the employer for being wary of people with such names, or for them to worry about who they are hiring. Finally, and in relation to the name-issue...tell me why crime, violence, theft, baby-abandonment, welfare-reliance and poorly educated children are so prevalent in the black community and culture? If an employer thinks he's going to interview some kid who walks in with 14 face tattoos or 6 pieces of stainless steel shoved through their nose and eyelids, or someone who speaks ghetto-English, can't read or write properly or has zero self-disciplne, of course they are going to try to avoid hring that person.

That's just common sense, and it's not the employers fault that they know of the chaos in the Black Community, and they do not want to take on additional problems which can cause a disruption of their business. Think of it this way....how employable do you think a guy named Adolph would have been in 1942? How many people named their kids Adolph after 1940? Not many... because they knew that name would hang like an anchor around their poor child's neck, and they wanted their child to have a successful life.

There is nothing racist in my observations...and those observations are based on fact. Are you telling me that the black community doesn't have a crime problem? Go to Chicago! Ha! Ha! Ha! Are you saying the black community doesn't have a single-mother problem? Before LBJ's Great Society Programs the black community had about a 75-80% marriage rate with a father in the home, and you had much less crime in the general black community. This was because there was a male influence in the home. Today, the Fatherless home rate in the black community is almost 80%. When the government started giving out cash to pregnant women...but stipulated that there be no men in the home ...the single Mother rate exploded and the development of so many great kids went to hell. That is a fact. I never said that I wouldn't hire Taquisha...but people who are trying to build or maintain a business would be very wary of hiring such a person due to the concern about the impact on their business. You completely skipped over my example of the name Adolph, because you understood my point, and you know it to be true. In business your goal is to attract as many customers as possible, and perception is reality. If Taniqua is applying for a job as a phone operator, and she can speak decent English, while communicating well, not many people would care about the name or the 14 pieces of steel puncturing her face. But if you think someone who speaks getto-English, has multiple facial spikes and has no clue how to operate in the business world is going to get hired in a customer-facing position, you are clueless. The employer will hire the person with whom their customer base is most comfortable, or their business will go broke. Those are the facts of life, and there is no racism in that thought process. You act as though people in general don't know about the dysfuntion of the black community, and they should simply hire anyone who rolls in. That is never going to happen if they question the applicants ability to live up to the job requirements. And I never used my wife as a token, I simply informed you that my wife is a different race and ethnicity than myself, so if I were a racist...that wouldn't make mcuh sense...eh? Ha! Ha! Ha!

So many questions you asked. 1. The hiring entity determines merit. With DEI, merit must be discarded in favor of (illegally) hiring from LGBTQ certified vendors & other groups to increase the company’s ESG score in order to get access funding. 2. Different perspectives are valuable to foster creativity. 3.I believe our current admin reflects diversity. 4. Of course a leader can make decisions that effect other races, a smart one seeks inputs fr all available sources/peoples & no one would know every input they’ve had/used to base a decision on. 5. Those in the know are aware that any statistic/metric can be easily manipulated to show a desired appearance. 6. Yes, I think DEI candidates are often less qualified. I was hired as one & the person after me was. I won’t discuss my details but the next person was a janitor where I worked. I always tried to encourage him to let me teach him office skills. He was terrified of the computer & said he was too scared to learn to even send an email. The job required excel & microsoft applications, extensive reports, etc. Many more qualified applicants were turned down & they gave him the job based on his skin color. I don’t think it was a good experience for him & definitely not for his coworkers who had to pick up the slack. That being said, hiring based on skin color is the least of my concerns. Personally, I believe in reparations. Our dna carries memory for decades. We are unconsciously affected by our past. Equating that w/ hiring based on intimate partner choice )certified lgbt vendors) is an insult to ppl of color imo bc anyone’s preference should be a personal matter that’s irrelevant & should not afford anyone an unfair hiring advantage. 7. I don’t doubt black women may be the most educated. All the ones I’ve known seem to be very strong, smart & driven ( not to mention kind & great cooks 
) 8. When you say equity, it sounds to me like you mean equality. (every one gets an equal chance at something) The difference in the DEI context is equity means everyone gets the same amount/outcome (“equitable” outcome) no matter skills, talents & drive to succeed/build (determined by the “stakeholders “ as they call themselves) They are a group of billionaires (the wef) who seek to govern globally & without election. They released a video stating we will own nothing (they will own all property & natural resources) & we will “be happy “ . That went over like a lead balloon so now they’ve scrubbed a lot from the internet & lie about it. It said we will rent everything which will be delivered by drone. They are coordinating & financing massive illegal immigration in several places in order to overload & break their systems to usher in global governance. The same billionaires touting this are the ones who for decades experimented on African kids like lab rats & reneged on paying the families what they promised. They are pompous, vile ppl. Their DEI agenda is a trick. The equity portion is akin to communism which sounds great in the beginning- everyone share the wealth equitably but history has proven it detrimental, mass poverty & death producing. It doesn’t work. Capitalism, although very imperfect, is the best system we have. Under communism, no one strives, ppl get lazy, uninspired. The free market- talent, exceptional skills & drive that are financially rewarded is what best solves the problems of the world. Sending love.",2025-01-25,reply,0

This need to exclude certain people in the name of inclusion follows from the Critical Social Justice Theory insistence that one of the features of systemic power and privilege is that all spaces are spaces in which the dominant groups’ cultures are welcomed and other cultures are excluded (by means of the hegemony of dominant culture). Thus, segregated “black only” spaces, for example, are considered a necessary corrective to whiteness and a form of desegregating those spaces, according to the Theory of Critical Social Justice.

The point you make is incorrect. The point is not to make sure These people aren’t eliminated and let’s choose the best. If they are the best candidate then they should get the job. The point is not having to find the best lesbian for fire chief when there is another person who is more qualified. It may be a black man but we have a lesbian quota. It’s a discriminatory practice. There are a lot of so called minorities who hate this practice as well. DEI has quotas and is measured. There is no place for it in our government and finally common sense is back,2025-02-01,reply,0

It means PRIORITIZING hiring of people because of the color of their skin or what they are perceived as “can’t do” instead of hiring the same people because of their merit and what they CAN do. DEI looks at a person and says “because they look a certain way or have a disability they automatically are disadvantaged” instead of looking at people for who they actually are.

As a nonmember, you may still purchase prescriptions from a Costco pharmacy with cash, debit, Costco Shop Cards or a Visa® card. However, you must be a paid member to enter the warehouse and purchase any other items. To sign up, simply stop by the membership counter at any Costco warehouse or you may sign up online as well. We take great pride in the quality and savings we offer our members. If you're ever dissatisfied, you can cancel your membership for a refund (of course, we'll do our best to ensure this isn't the case!). -Max",2025-02-08,reply,1

Most of them are telling me how I benefit from DEI, although my employer does not and has not participated in it. Why would I want to benefit from it? I am concerned for Americans. Not myself, not the members of whichever political affiliation I agree with the most, not just women. There is this selfish undertone that I should agree with it because I benefit from it. On the contrary, the negativity and senseless hatred I see as a direct result of this defunct policy is the number one reason it won’t work. It was implemented prior to be being scrutinized to ensure it was appropriate, it was blindly accepted as the end to systemic racism while we are all experiencing the worst level of division since the 1960’s, and it places us all in our respective racial and even sexual preference groups. I reject this in favor of what most of us have inherent in us and were taught from an early age: treat all people how you would like to be treated.

I provide the source for global guidelines on this below. Affirmative Action was deemed unconstitutional because it does not align with the liberties afforded to all citizens by our constitution. The premise of equality for all, as we are guaranteed as citizens, cannot properly be afforded without a colorblind society. This does not mean we try to erase history, and it also does not mean we disregard the experiences of those who are considered to have a boost in society by DEI standards. In its most recent form, and more so in mass media, social media, and in some politicians minds, this is affirmative action with a prettier name. DEI was pushed onto corporations large and small, along with schools of higher education, with financial incentives for those who choose to report to an organization that isn’t for *all* human rights. For example, both Harvard and Penn State both required between 300 and 500 points less from those who benefit from DEI. That is not inclusive. But even more important is that it is not understood by a legal standpoint by the news outlets that air or publish DEI-related content, the celebrities our children might look up to, and too many of the politicians tasked with creating or abolishing any given policy. And if you ask 100 people what DEI means, you will get 100 different answers. It is not bipartisan by any means. And its specific goals are not outlined in black and white for the average citizen.

I have the receipt email showing that I purchased it and AT&T says I’ve never purchased. It says they’ll put notes in the file. nobody calls me, and there are no notes, so I ask what happened and they said they could sell me $100 cruise line it didn’t work bottom line is I use the phone three times and a few text it cost me $550 and Costco AT&T want to talk to me about it Costco says they’ll have somebody call me.

After taxes it comes out to .40 cents. Taco shop are paying their employees 20.00 to start and Costco is paying less. If you don’t work there you just don’t know what we as employees are fighting for. I know the turn over is very low but employees made it happen for the company raises prices and membership fees, but no on the salary of their employees. Join us on the picket line on strike day that might happen on Feb 1, if Costco does not want to renew the new contract and have a wage increase, better retirement and take care of the employees.

How the black ladies at the welfare office told me to my face I couldn't get any help (when I was a battered wife and became homeless) because I was white. And I'll never forget their faces as they laughed at me at one of the worst moments in my life. How that when I moved to a black neighborhood people treated me poorly and called me names and stole from me. How when I was a student (Elementary school through High School) the black girls would threatened to beat me up for literally no reason which caused me to leave class as quickly as possible and run home. Yeah, that's all ""ridiculous"".",2025-02-01,reply,2

You were a battered wife and homeless because you were white? Try not smart enough to not let a man beat you up. You couldn't get a job because you were white? Try maybe you didn't have the education or experience. You couldn't get financial aid because you were white? I can tell by that statement you never really applied for financial aid. The black girls beat you up because you were white? Maybe it was because you were a junior racist in training with a nasty personality.,2025-02-01,reply,1

Good value, great product and I push it on people because I want it to always be there. However, it has the deadly MALTODEXTRIN chemical in it. This is a higher glycemic index food than white sugar at 136 GI!!!! Very bad just like MSG and Corn Syrup. It should never be put into any food. I absolutely need this ingredient removed from Superior Touch. Please consider working with this company to produce bouillon paste without any Maltodextrin. Please stock Beef Bouillon paste and Veg paste too. They work like Marmite on toast and essential in everything from rice to soups to sauces. I am going to contact the company as well. If I do not get a response with a new product sans Maltodextrin, I will be elevating this to get more visibility at a govt level with the Health Dept or other agency. I am very serious about this. NO PRODUCT FIT FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION SHOULD CONTAIN MALTODEXTRIN, MSG, OR OTHER TOXIN. OUR FOOD MUST BE CLEAN AND SAFE. This is the reason for obesity in America - sugar, Md in everything. I have stopped buying this or recommending to customers and friends and looking for other sources of bouillon paste without toxic chemicals in it.",2025-02-16,initial,0

The Pork Shoulder Butt is referring to a piece of meat on the upper shoulder of the hog that is close to the neck. The back end of the hog is called the ham. In colonial New England, butchers packed inexpensive cuts of meat into large barrels, called Butts, for storage and transportation. The pork shoulder meat packed into these barrels became known as Boston Butt (or Pork Butt), and the name stuck. Hope this helps! -Ernie",2025-02-23,reply,0

What we wanted and as Rev Martin Luther King preached, was to be treated equally to others. Judge as by our character, our work, our work ethic. DEI, Affirmative action etc treats us as if we are LESS than others, and need special help to succeed. Kind of like we are the runt of the human species. Need to give us special attention. All I ever asked for is an even playing field. When someone sees my home, my diploma, etc I know their first thought is that I did not fully earn it.

They voted for Trump because they feared a changing world, longing for a return to a past that felt safer. But while they focused on fighting social change, they ignored the far greater threat of technological change. They believe they are resisting an elite takeover, yet they celebrate billionaires like Musk, who are accelerating the very forces that will replace their jobs, control their speech, and make them obsolete. They rage against globalism but bow to a man whose ambitions span the globe and beyond, stretching into space. They fight for sovereignty yet cheer for someone who believes he alone should dictate the future of civilization.

I’ve never had a bad experience with Costco before and I don’t know what to do because I’m not getting anywhere with calling Costco. I was waiting for a little end table to be delivered and I found out today that they delivered it to Atlanta, Georgia instead of Dallas, Texas. The UPS store in Atlanta was so kind. They called me when the recipient brought it back in. Instead of sending another label and redirecting it or even replacing the table they told me that “their system couldn’t handle the problem!” That it was out of stock and there’s nothing they could do except perhaps return and refund me but I wanted the table so I ended up paying to have UPS create a label for $32. The table cost under $100. They will be shipping it to me in a few days. It just doesn’t seem right since it was their mistake that they’re not willing to pay for the label any thoughts? Thank you. ￼",2025-02-16,initial,0

After you take each candidate seriously, you still hire the most competent and capable people given the job requirements.
