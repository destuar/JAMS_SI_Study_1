I’ve been working with them for 21 yrs and don’t want to pay us the reasonable wages. The contract is expiring and after making 7.4 billion dollars after covid and given managers a 30% raise but only the employees a 1 dollar. Just look at cost of living. 1 dollar is not enough. After taxes it comes out to .40 cents. Taco shop are paying their employees 20.00 to start and Costco is paying less. If you don’t work there you just don’t know what we as employees are fighting for. I know the turn over is very low but employees made it happen for the company raises prices and membership fees, but no on the salary of their employees. Join us on the picket line on strike day that might happen on Feb 1, if Costco does not want to renew the new contract and have a wage increase, better retirement and take care of the employees. I can hold a spot for you next to me. Costco want to pay non union employees by bringing them to cover on feb 1.
