It appears that Costco optical is forcing me to buy a new frame every year or Costco thinks its frame is so poor quality that it should not last for more than 1 year. I do not like this policy/behavior of optical department. In my opinion, the only logical reason of it can be forcing me to buy new frame every year.",2025-02-08,initial,0
