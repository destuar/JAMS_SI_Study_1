How the black ladies at the welfare office told me to my face I couldn't get any help (when I was a battered wife and became homeless) because I was white. And I'll never forget their faces as they laughed at me at one of the worst moments in my life. How that when I moved to a black neighborhood people treated me poorly and called me names and stole from me. How when I was a student (Elementary school through High School) the black girls would threatened to beat me up for literally no reason which caused me to leave class as quickly as possible and run home.
