They don’t hate their customers, a lot of the items you would normally get at Costco are cheaper too!

FAA did this, Walmart did it (and their standards were pretty low to begin with), Costo, etc. Target! Geez, last time I was in a target, a man dressed as a woman was following me around, and he was an employee. I don't know why he was following me around but it was unnerving. And he wasn't security because he wasn't dressed as Target security, but as a stock boy. Another time, I was sitting at home minding my own business and a women dressed in a full burka came out of an unmarked car (some sedan) and started walking up to my door. She had a box in her hand and she put it in front of my door. I had no clue what was going on. Turns out it was an Amazon delivery. I live in the country. You don't come to a house in the country dressed in a burka unless you want to get shot. I complained to Amazon, and that never happened again. Now they come in Amazon attire and most of the time in a marked vehicle.",

In my mind they don't practice what they preach and are only inclusive when it convenient and suits a narrative.",

Purchased the Cruise phone package from AT&T after purchasing my phone from Costco. Got on the ship and it never worked. I have the receipt email showing that I purchased it and AT&T says I’ve never purchased. It says they’ll put notes in the file. nobody calls me, and there are no notes, so I ask what happened and they said they could sell me $100 cruise line it didn’t work bottom line is I use the phone three times and a few text it cost me $550 and Costco AT&T want to talk to me about it Costco says they’ll have somebody call me. AT&T calls me literally 14 times this person has called And never ever told me a time to call back or when I answer it hangs up this is a joke. Do not get your phone at Costco from AT&T.",
