Good value, great product and I push it on people because I want it to always be there. However, it has the deadly MALTODEXTRIN chemical in it. This is a higher glycemic index food than white sugar at 136 GI!!!! Very bad just like MSG and Corn Syrup. It should never be put into any food. I absolutely need this ingredient removed from Superior Touch. Please consider working with this company to produce bouillon paste without any Maltodextrin. Please stock Beef Bouillon paste and Veg paste too. They work like Marmite on toast and essential in everything from rice to soups to sauces. I am going to contact the company as well. If I do not get a response with a new product sans Maltodextrin, I will be elevating this to get more visibility at a govt level with the Health Dept or other agency. I am very serious about this. NO PRODUCT FIT FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION SHOULD CONTAIN MALTODEXTRIN, MSG, OR OTHER TOXIN. OUR FOOD MUST BE CLEAN AND SAFE. This is the reason for obesity in America - sugar, Md in everything.
