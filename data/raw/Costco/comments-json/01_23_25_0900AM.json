      "text": "...well sweetie...you are in fact trying to influence people with your comments, otherwise you wouldn't be making them. The first rule of communication is that we communicate for the purpose of getting what we want. Communication is about getting something that we want. If you stop and think about it, there is no communication that that doesn't involve trying to get what you want. For example....you see someone walking down the hall with an untied shoelace. At some level, you either don't want the person to trip...and / or...you want to be the one to warn the person about the potential for tripping...so you communicate to them that their shoe is untied. Either way...you wanted something out of the encounter...so you communicated. Simple as that. If you can give me an example of communication that doesn't involve trying to get something you want...I'm all ears! Ha! In my nearly 40 years of developing people, no one has ever been able to give me an example of communication that doesn't involve getting what they want. So your desire to comment for days at a time about this subject involves you getting what you want. Perhaps you are being paid to communicate and defend Costco's DEI practices...and that is your motivation...(Money equals safety and security...the first two goals of all humanity). But even if you are being paid, the zealotry you bring to the comments and your willingness to insult, demean and abuse others shows that your primary communication style is driven by your Parental Ego State. On the other hand...I primarily operate out of an Adult Ego State...and I only choose to use the Parental Ego State when I want to poke fun at an idea, comment or person. You and a few others on this thread use the Parental Ego State...and it's fun to poke the bear! Ha! Ha! Ha! When I comment, my goal is to influence the way people think, and I almost always start out from an adult ego state. But when I run into people who are incapable of active listening...or have a goal other than to express themselves and influence others...I have great fun taking their comments apart...and that sometimes includes using the Parental Ego State. I never use the Child Ego State, where someone is always blaming others for the negative outcomes in their life, but there are plenty of people on this thread using it...as they need to find someone to balme for the negative outcomes in their life. Thus the need to blame \"racism\" for their personal failures. I hope that clears it up for you. Ha! Ha! Ha!",

So from your perspective ...if employee A receives a raise...either for longevity or exceptional performance, then everyone else in the work environment should also have their pay raised...so everyone has \"Equity\"? Ha! Ha! Ha! That's too funny. I gave you very logical, accurate and truthful reasons why the statistical gap in wages exists, based on cultural and personal choices of those effected. I accurately pointed out that the numbers of woman taking on lower paying wages is based on their choice, but you chose to ignore that information due to your zealotry, jealousy and lazy nature. Your comment about pay increases for performance or longevity would be hilarious if they weren't so sad. You refuse to acknowledge that the choices women make impact their ability to make more money. Where are the oil-rig women? Where are the brick-laying women? Where are the high-wire steel-working women? Bonus and perfromance pay increases can be individual, and they can be team-oriented around goal accomplishment or other factors...but when you compare female-to-male, job-to-job starting pay...there is no wage gap. You have no idea what you are talking about, as your stupid comment about having babies displays. Yes, some people take a couple of weeks out of work to have their baby, and some take months or years out of the workforce to care for their babies. Some women choose to take a decade out of the workforce to establish their familes, then they go back to work. But on the broader analysis of the data, pregancy impacts women much more than men, and limits those longevity or perfromance increases because they go in and out of the workforce.",

I was raised by corrupt, racist, drunken parents who were in law enforcement. My Dad was a six-foot-nine, 350 pound racist St. Louis Cop and my Mother was a corrupt Court Clerk who was charged with embezzling $80,000 from the ticket fund to finance her BINGO habit. I and my siblings were beaten, yelled at and humilated in so many ways, it shocked the therapist. I wrote a book about the experience, and am working on having it made into a movie. The Book is called Webster Groves, and is available on Amazon and other book sellers. I was also a Federally Protected Whistle Blower for over 20 years with US DoD, and was abused by them for two decades, until I forced them into retiring me on disability when I began to pass out while teaching large Management Development Classes for DoD... work due to their abuses. The therapist helped me with managing those issues as well. But the best use of therapy was when I was diagnosed as having been epileptic at the age of 49, and told that I had been enduring unobserved seizures throughout my life. I was also diagnosed with a condition called \"Post Seizure Fugue State\"... where once I have a seizure I can complete remarkable tasks for about an hour after the seizure, and have no awareness that I am doing anything, nor any memory of having done anything. This conditon manifested itself one day when I had a seizure and unknowingly drove a car. I ended up driving off a 200 foot cliff at 70 mph, with my body being sucked out the back window and getting tossed 200 feet down the cliff. I woke up for a heartbeat as the rescue helicoptor lifted me from the canyon floor. I was hospitalized with my back broken in four spots, my neck broken in 3 places, six broken ribs, a crushed tailbone, a 93 stitch gash across my face....and a 19 staple rip to my brain. My unkown epilepsy delivered several near death experiences...while I was working in war zones and other unique situations. The therapy really helped me to process this lifelong disabilty and it's effect on my life. The therapy helped me to understand that much of my desire to understand how my brain worked, wasn't due to prior trauma, but due to the unknown seizures. I hope that clears up the therapy thing for you, but feel free to make fun of me some more...as I have had a incredible life, and I always appreciate the opportunity to tell my story! Ha! Ha! Ha!",

Speak to your God and ask why it created such tribalism in humanirty... (a key component of racism). Ask the parents why they named thier child Naquisha, Taquisha, Nettabelle, Draper, Baby Ruth, Mertie, Excel, Brownie ...etc., etc, etc.? If they wanted to give their kids unique names ...great! But don't blame the employer for being wary of people with such names, or for them to worry about who they are hiring. Finally, and in relation to the name-issue...tell me why crime, violence, theft, baby-abandonment, welfare-reliance and poorly educated children are so prevalent in the black community and culture? If an employer thinks he's going to interview some kid who walks in with 14 face tattoos or 6 pieces of stainless steel shoved through their nose and eyelids, or someone who speaks ghetto-English, can't read or write properly or has zero self-disciplne, of course they are going to try to avoid hring that person. If the person has some basic skills, enthusiasm and work ethic, many people won't care...but if you have to put them in a customer service position where the clients do care...they will be hestitent to hire such a person. That's just common sense, and it's not the employers fault that they know of the chaos in the Black Community, and they do not want to take on additional problems which can cause a disruption of their business. Think of it this way....how employable do you think a guy named Adolph would have been in 1942? How many people named their kids Adolph after 1940? Not many... because they knew that name would hang like an anchor around their poor child's neck, and they wanted their child to have a successful life. The day you can breed the inherent tribalism out if humanity...and bring the acceptable social behaviors of all cultures into more harmony, such gut-reactions to different cultures will continue.",

      "text": "...you have a problem with losing...so all you can do is play the race card. There is nothing racist in my observations...and those observations are based on fact. Are you telling me that the black community doesn't have a crime problem? Go to Chicago! Ha! Ha! Ha! Are you saying the black community doesn't have a single-mother problem? Before LBJ's Great Society Programs the black community had about a 75-80% marriage rate with a father in the home, and you had much less crime in the general black community. This was because there was a male influence in the home. Today, the Fatherless home rate in the black community is almost 80%. When the government started giving out cash to pregnant women...but stipulated that there be no men in the home ...the single Mother rate exploded and the development of so many great kids went to hell. That is a fact. I never said that I wouldn't hire Taquisha...but people who are trying to build or maintain a business would be very wary of hiring such a person due to the concern about the impact on their business. You completely skipped over my example of the name Adolph, because you understood my point, and you know it to be true. In business your goal is to attract as many customers as possible, and perception is reality. If Taniqua is applying for a job as a phone operator, and she can speak decent English, while communicating well, not many people would care about the name or the 14 pieces of steel puncturing her face. But if you think someone who speaks getto-English, has multiple facial spikes and has no clue how to operate in the business world is going to get hired in a customer-facing position, you are clueless. The employer will hire the person with whom their customer base is most comfortable, or their business will go broke. Those are the facts of life, and there is no racism in that thought process. You act as though people in general don't know about the dysfuntion of the black community, and they should simply hire anyone who rolls in. That is never going to happen if they question the applicants ability to live up to the job requirements. And I never used my wife as a token, I simply informed you that my wife is a different race and ethnicity than myself, so if I were a racist...that wouldn't make mcuh sense...eh? Ha! Ha! Ha! You seem to be \"offended\" by so much, perhaps you should take your blankie and go hide in a closet somewhere. Ha! Ha! Ha!",

People are not economic units. There’s no perfect way to evaluate them and there is NEVER a situation where two candidates are completely equal in skill level, education, experience, interview ability, personality, etc. It just doesn’t happen. There may be times when you’ve got two good candidates that might be tough to choose between, but that doesn’t mean you go with the minority. In those cases, HR generally works with the hiring manager to decide which qualifications would be the most important. Maybe for a sales role, you have to great candidates but one is better at phone sales and one seems to be better at door to door sales so you choose based on which is most prevalent in the company.",

      "text": "I appreciate where you are coming from. So many questions you asked. 1. The hiring entity determines merit. With DEI, merit must be discarded in favor of (illegally) hiring from LGBTQ certified vendors & other groups to increase the company’s ESG score in order to get access funding. 2. Different perspectives are valuable to foster creativity. 3.I believe our current admin reflects diversity. 4. Of course a leader can make decisions that effect other races, a smart one seeks inputs fr all available sources/peoples & no one would know every input they’ve had/used to base a decision on. 5. Those in the know are aware that any statistic/metric can be easily manipulated to show a desired appearance. 6. Yes, I think DEI candidates are often less qualified. I was hired as one & the person after me was. I won’t discuss my details but the next person was a janitor where I worked. I always tried to encourage him to let me teach him office skills. He was terrified of the computer & said he was too scared to learn to even send an email. The job required excel & microsoft applications, extensive reports, etc. Many more qualified applicants were turned down & they gave him the job based on his skin color. I don’t think it was a good experience for him & definitely not for his coworkers who had to pick up the slack. That being said, hiring based on skin color is the least of my concerns. Personally, I believe in reparations. Our dna carries memory for decades. We are unconsciously affected by our past. Equating that w/ hiring based on intimate partner choice )certified lgbt vendors) is an insult to ppl of color imo bc anyone’s preference should be a personal matter that’s irrelevant & should not afford anyone an unfair hiring advantage. 7. I don’t doubt black women may be the most educated. All the ones I’ve known seem to be very strong, smart & driven ( not to mention kind & great cooks \n) 8. When you say equity, it sounds to me like you mean equality. (every one gets an equal chance at something) The difference in the DEI context is equity means everyone gets the same amount/outcome (“equitable” outcome) no matter skills, talents & drive to succeed/build (determined by the “stakeholders “ as they call themselves) They are a group of billionaires (the wef) who seek to govern globally & without election. They released a video stating we will own nothing (they will own all property & natural resources) & we will “be happy “ . That went over like a lead balloon so now they’ve scrubbed a lot from the internet & lie about it. It said we will rent everything which will be delivered by drone. They are coordinating & financing massive illegal immigration in several places in order to overload & break their systems to usher in global governance. The same billionaires touting this are the ones who for decades experimented on African kids like lab rats & reneged on paying the families what they promised. They are pompous, vile ppl. Their DEI agenda is a trick. The equity portion is akin to communism which sounds great in the beginning- everyone share the wealth equitably but history has proven it detrimental, mass poverty & death producing. It doesn’t work. Capitalism, although very imperfect, is the best system we have. Under communism, no one strives, ppl get lazy, uninspired. The free market- talent, exceptional skills & drive that are financially rewarded is what best solves the problems of the world. Sending love.",

No matter one’s beliefs, don’t you find it beyond odd that all at once several countries decided trans ppl & mass immigration should be their priority? They want to overwhelm systems to eliminate sovereignty. This is beyond the United States & beyond Republican/Democrat. George Soros & his elitist clan are trying to lay their groundwork for acceptance of global, unelected govt. They hate Trump bc he announced at wef that we will keep our sovereignty. I actually believe in reparations- history/memories are held in dna for generations & imo it’s disingenuous to discredit that. I have seen the wef billionaires discussing & laughing about all the money they will make from their agenda. I benefited from being a DEI hire. It does include discrimination & quotas- even though they’re burying the quota part now. They’re hiding what they’re really trying to accomplish w/ “equity “ (nefarious) in between diversity (fabulous) & inclusion (wonderful).",

This need to exclude certain people in the name of inclusion follows from the Critical Social Justice Theory insistence that one of the features of systemic power and privilege is that all spaces are spaces in which the dominant groups’ cultures are welcomed and other cultures are excluded (by means of the hegemony of dominant culture). Thus, segregated “black only” spaces, for example, are considered a necessary corrective to whiteness and a form of desegregating those spaces, according to the Theory of Critical Social Justice. In this sense, “inclusion,” always implies restrictions on speech. This is why people are opposed to it.",

I'm known as Mrs. Costco and I shop 2-3 time at week at Costco each time spending well over $300.00, please look up my account. I'm disgusted with Costco and its retention of a hiring practice that separates people, not because of ability but because a liberal, political stance! I see no benefit in hiring incompetence! I'm mad as heck, that a company, such as yourself, that can't retain its good workers as is, would hire because of diversity and NOT COMPETENCY or excellence! We as customers want to be able to speak intelligently to a Costco employee that supposedly has some knowledge of the store. No ignoring, turning their backs and running away and no sending us to someone else because they have no idea what is going on. We enjoy knowing that the employees recognize us and acknowledge us because you retain for years your employees, not hiring because of DIVERSITY! Many fly by night, diverse employees are here today, gone tomorrow for one paycheck and then never show up again because it's too much work! I'm noticing that many new hires are now congregating in non used spaces at Costco to get away from the crowds, is this the environment you want to project,VERY NON PROFESSIONAL and extremely unapproachable. I've also noticed less than professional images on your new hires and many last only a few weeks...WHY WOULD YOU want to project this image? Do you think this image attracts and retains customers!? Remember the old adage, YOU ARE NEVER TOO BIG TO FAIL (WANG0! Your OLD administration and owners had the right ideas, the CUSTOMERS are everything!
