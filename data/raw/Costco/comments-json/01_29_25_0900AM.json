After taxes it comes out to .40 cents. Taco shop are paying their employees 20.00 to start and Costco is paying less. If you don’t work there you just don’t know what we as employees are fighting for. I know the turn over is very low but employees made it happen for the company raises prices and membership fees, but no on the salary of their employees. Join us on the picket line on strike day that might happen on Feb 1, if Costco does not want to renew the new contract and have a wage increase, better retirement and take care of the employees. I can hold a spot for you next to me. Costco want to pay non union employees by bringing them to cover on feb 1.

Did you know Black people weren't allowed to borrow money to open businesses or buy houses for most of the 20th century and before? Did you know Black people are STILL considered 7/8 of a human being in the Constitution? It goes on and on. It's only fair they are given some extra consideration in creating a balanced work force. I've faced some of the same things as a single white woman. I also don't have the same rights as a man in the Constitution. Why is that? We OWE the people we repressed for centuries a chance to catch up. The dumbest part about this: Are YOU trying to get hired at Costco and you just can't nail down that job because of DEI? I doubt it. Why do you even CARE if Costco wants to make sure everybody is included?",
