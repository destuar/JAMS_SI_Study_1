The Pork Shoulder Butt is referring to a piece of meat on the upper shoulder of the hog that is close to the neck. The back end of the hog is called the ham. In colonial New England, butchers packed inexpensive cuts of meat into large barrels, called Butts, for storage and transportation. The pork shoulder meat packed into these barrels became known as Boston Butt (or Pork Butt), and the name stuck. Hope this helps! -Ernie",2025-02-23,reply,0

What we wanted and as Rev Martin Luther King preached, was to be treated equally to others. Judge as by our character, our work, our work ethic. DEI, Affirmative action etc treats us as if we are LESS than others, and need special help to succeed. Kind of like we are the runt of the human species. Need to give us special attention. All I ever asked for is an even playing field. When someone sees my home, my diploma, etc I know their first thought is that I did not fully earn it.
