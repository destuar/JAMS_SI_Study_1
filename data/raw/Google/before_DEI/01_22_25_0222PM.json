These two proteins are hydrolyzed to produce many functional subunits of the viral replication complex. In this hydrolysis process, the main proteolytic enzyme of SARS coronavirus (main protease, abbreviated as M pro , molecular weight 33.8 kDa, sometimes called 3C-Like Protein) plays a very important role. The main protease is also a segment of ppla and pplab, its release is achieved by autocatalytic hydrolysis, and autocatalytic hydrolysis occurs at the Gln S er , Al a ) site beside the protease, by trans-splicing (bi-molecular reaction) carry out. Under the action of the main protease, the replicase polyproteins ppla and pplab are hydrolyzed into more than a dozen functional peptides, which further play a role. If it can inhibit the hydrolysis of SARS coronavirus main protease, it will effectively resist the infection of SARS coronavirus. Therefore, SARS coronavirus primary protease is an ideal target for anti-SARS drug design. Summary of invention",
