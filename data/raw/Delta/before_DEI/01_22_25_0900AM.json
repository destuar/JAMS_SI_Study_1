I’m at a lot of time that I can’t get back, I have over $1,500 in expenses for a trip that I could not make it on due to Delta Air Lines issues and not that of my own. I spent well over twelve hours yesterday traveling from ATL-MCO and back. Our plane was flooded due to an alleged pipe burst. I could’ve made my cruise if you all were forthcoming considering all I would have had to do was drive by no, there was issue after issue even once we landed in MCO still could have made my trip but we were stuck on the runway due to no gates being available. This is unacceptable and I’m very disappointed in this. I would hope that you all will be compensating me for my expenses as again I’ve paid for something that I could not enjoy due to your errors not mine. I will post receipts if needed. You all need to do better with you handling of customers and ensuring that you are truthful in your responses.",

It was delayed little by little until a new plane was sent in, but doing the math, there is no way Delta did not know that the plane would not take off before at least 10 a.m., meaning most of us would miss our connections. Why, then would Delta not send a new plane right away? We ended up having to rebook TWICE at the gate because of these changes. I can explain the math to a representative when contacted. Also, on our second flight, Delta had the audacity to announce an “early arrival” before we then had to wait 20 minutes on the tarmac for the plane in our arrival gate to load more bags!
