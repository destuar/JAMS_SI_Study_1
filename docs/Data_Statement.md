## 2 | Research purpose
Enable causal tests of how continuing vs. rolling‑back DEI programmes alters boycott‑ and buy‑intent language, while examining whether perceived brand authenticity buffers backlash.

Exempt IRB §46.104(d)(4)(ii): publicly available data.  Collection performed via manual scrolling of publicly visible posts; no automated API calls, login spoofing, or rate‑limit circumvention.  Immediately after collection the dataset is stripped of user IDs, profile links, photos, and @‑mentions.

*(Full compliance checklist, Facebook TOS excerpts, and GDPR/CCPA assessment are provided in **ethics.md**.)*

All visible comments and replies on the focal DEI announcement post for each brand, plus comments in the −15 day pre‑announcement buffer to establish a baseline, and +30 days post‑announcement to capture reaction decay.
