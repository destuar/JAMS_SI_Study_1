I’m surprised Costco would want to associate themselves with that sort of thing. It sure seems to be upsetting a huge percentage of their membership base. I went to Sam’s Club today for the first time after seeing how much Costco hates their customers and employees. It was funny, I spoke to 10 separate people that had also cancelled their membership and was shopping at Sam’s. For anyone interested there is a 50% off Groupon deal for a Sam’s membership. They don’t hate their customers, a lot of the items you would normally get at Costco are cheaper too! Maybe Costco has a strategy for how many memberships they are going to lose but I can guarantee you that any new memberships they do get from the left, it won’t come close to what they lose.
