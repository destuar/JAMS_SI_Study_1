Most companies like grocery stores provide the same as Costco. Acme for example gives their employees 3 PH's, sick pay per law, and vacation weeks based on how much time you've worked for the company. However any store type of chain won't give you off on major holidays. So yes they give you off on the little ones like June Nineteenth making it look like inclusion by saying it like Costco did ....but not Christmas or Easter. How is that fair for those who are religious? They literally black out those days so you can't even request off in most stores. Including the ""inclusive DEI"" stores. How is that inclusive? It's not. It's only inclusive if you fall under certain categories. Which is minorities and any gender that isn't your biological gender.

No retail/grocery store allows their employees to have off on Easter or Christmas unless the entire company has off. If the company is closed the day of the holiday...they don't allow them the day before the holiday. Not big holidays. So no Christmas Eve. This is a FACT. You know nothing. Your comment proves this. All you did was copy Costco's policy. You're under the false impression that Costco or any company follows this for ALL. They pick and choose. There are exceptions.

They have a designated line for Costco AT&T customers, but that is of no use whatsoever. You’re talking to AT&T people and they do not care. Purchased the Cruise phone package from AT&T after purchasing my phone from Costco. Got on the ship and it never worked. I have the receipt email showing that I purchased it and AT&T says I’ve never purchased. It says they’ll put notes in the file. nobody calls me, and there are no notes, so I ask what happened and they said they could sell me $100 cruise line it didn’t work bottom line is I use the phone three times and a few text it cost me $550 and Costco AT&T want to talk to me about it Costco says they’ll have somebody call me. AT&T calls me literally 14 times this person has called And never ever told me a time to call back or when I answer it hangs up this is a joke.

It means PRIORITIZING hiring of people because of the color of their skin or what they are perceived as “can’t do” instead of hiring the same people because of their merit and what they CAN do. DEI looks at a person and says “because they look a certain way or have a disability they automatically are disadvantaged” instead of looking at people for who they actually are.
