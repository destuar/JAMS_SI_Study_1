They sat directly behind me and were belligerent and foul mouthed, especially the woman, and spent 10 minutes swearing and criticizing the lead flight attendant for being a \"sargeant\" because she was telling people to put their seat backs up, tray tables up, and stow their backpacks under the seat for takeoff. Thankfully the flight attendant was well aware of what they were doing, and after the pilot announced a brief delay, two policemen came on the plane and removed them. Hooray! But today's crash is exactly why flight attendants enforce these safety measures. If you're in a crash and survive, you need every possible advantage to get off the plane safely. The jerks that, on occasion, still recline their seat on take off after the flight attendants have been seated could cause the people in the row behind them to die by not being able to get out of their row.",
