The crew of both (FULL) flights were professional and handled passengers who didnt know where their seat was, well - time after time. Ed Bastian these folks deserve a RAISE - you should be proud of all of them!!!!! On a down side dont care much for the new airbus planes, cabin noise in places is louder than it should be and the AC control on one plane came away from its housing and could be pushed up. No biggie but detracts from the experience. Do Delta plan on adopting the European standard for cabin baggage? I wish all airlines would reduce the size of allowed cabin baggage.",
