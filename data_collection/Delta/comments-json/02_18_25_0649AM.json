The vast majority of passengers don’t differentiate between mainline and regional carriers because airlines market these flights under their own brand.\" You still didn't really answer the question that I posed. You appear to be on a mission, of which I will not participate. I notice that there are many positive comments on this Delta Air Lines' post, which is just wonderful. I feel that airline safety has improved over the last 15+ years, but perhaps I am one of those who doesn't have have half a brain, as you have stated. But I am smart enough to recognize a negative energy 'I'm' the smartest person in the room\" statement. Enjoy your rant(s).",

So I feel so much better knowing the 80 passengers were rescued safety from an almost disaster which would have made us all really doubt the whole industry . But lives don’t have to be lost to question what and why this is happening . I have never seen anything like this . So I still see no explanation as to why a perfectly landing plane turned upside down . Are we using less skilled pilots or those who don’t have much experience yet . One has no option but to be transparent as another way of handling this will simply not work . Glad that the passengers are safe but it still leaves a very unsettling state in my mind as we are more in the air than land \n! I feel for all those who experienced such a traumatic event",

Cross wind was at higher spectrum for the plane but within limits. I would be curious how plane was handling on the way in. Was their indications of how bad the wind is that they should have maybe done a go around? Wait for facts to come out but don't blame the pilots.
